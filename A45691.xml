         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Crown is falne from our Head; Wo unto us that we have ſinned.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Words put forth themſelves into theſe three Branches.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here is the <hi>Calamity</hi> of the People of God, <hi>the Crown was faln from their head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, <hi>We have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Effect</hi> of both, they take up a wofull <hi>Lamentation</hi> upon both theſe Conſiderations, the latter eſpecially; <hi>Wo unto us that we have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me a little open the Words: <hi>Our Head;</hi> The Head <hi>ſpirituall</hi> is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37085:5"/>cannot <hi>fall,</hi> nor his <hi>Crown</hi> from him: but they ſpeake here of the <hi>Civill,</hi> the outward and viſible Head of the State, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.15. <hi>The Ancient and Honourable he is the Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Crown;</hi> that is, The Emblem of Praeeminece and Authority, and an Ornament in them that have no Authority: as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.4. <hi>A verteous Woman is a Crown to her Husband;</hi> Not a <hi>Ring</hi> for his Finger, or a <hi>Chain</hi> for his Neck, but a Crown for his Head, a choice and chief Ornament: So here they are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who was the Glory and chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their State; and ſo the Hebrew Doctors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it. I know the <hi>Seventy</hi> ſay, it was written in the time of their Captivity, and upon that occaſion only; and this is embraced generally our Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But why might not <hi>Jeremy</hi> look upon it as then preſent, though thirty years before they did go into Captivity, and four Princes Reigns between? And that paſſage in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. warrants this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>And</hi> Jeremiah <hi>lamented for</hi> Joſiah, <hi>and all the ſinging Men and the ſinging Women ſpake of</hi> Joſiah <hi>in their Lamentations to this day, and made them an Ordinance in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and behold they are written in the Lamentations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wo,</hi> is ſometimes put for a word of <hi>Threatning,</hi> or Propheticall Denunciation, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Wo unto thee</hi> Chorazin, <hi>wo unto thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. from the 13. to the 17. Verſe; <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſes, Hypocrites.</hi> Sometimes 'tis uſed as a word of <hi>Pitty,</hi> of Commiſeration; as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. <hi>Wo unto thee,</hi> or <hi>Alas for thee O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Wilt thou not be made clean? When ſhall it once be?</hi> Sometimes for a word of <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> or acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſad and calamitous Eſtate; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37085:5"/>5. <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in</hi> Meſech, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar, amongſt theſe ſpirituall Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moors: ſo in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Wo is me,</hi> or <hi>I am diſtreſſed,</hi> or <hi>in anguiſh, for thee my Brother</hi> Jonathan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here it may be taken in all theſe ſenſes; <hi>We</hi> unto us <hi>Now,</hi> (for <hi>Now</hi> is in the Original) our wo is Now begun, and it will multiply; they felt and foreſaw miſery coming on, their preſent ſorrow was great, and their expectation was far worſe, they ſaw the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> in the <hi>Antecedents,</hi> they ſaw the <hi>Effects</hi> in their <hi>Cauſes;</hi> And ſo may we, unleſs through infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thoſe <hi>Cauſes</hi> be timely removed. The words thus explained will yield us three Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>It is a mater of wofull lamentation to Gods people, when God cauſeth the Crown to fall from their heads.</hi> when the Glory, the cheif Ornament falls from their State, from their Government.</p>
            <p>When a <hi>Jacob</hi> dies, though as a Rick of <hi>ripe Corn</hi> he be gathered into the <hi>Barn,</hi> yet even the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> will mourn for him, and that with <hi>a grievous mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gen.</hi> 50.3.11. And ſhall not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then mourne for a <hi>Moſes?</hi> ſahll not wee mourne for our <hi>Moſes?</hi> of whom I am perſwaded after-Ages will ſay as they of him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10. <hi>And there aroſe not a Protector ſince in</hi> England, (how many ſoever we may have) <hi>like unto him, whom the Lord knew face to face,</hi> (who had ſuch intimate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him) <hi>In all the ſigns and the wonders which the Lord ſent him to do in the Land of Aegypt, to</hi> Pharoah <hi>and to all his Servants, and to all his Land; And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which</hi> Moſes <hi>ſhewed in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And yet you may obſerve, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> mourned longer <hi>Jacob,</hi> then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37085:6"/>they ſeventy dayes, theſe but thirty; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people of God are, and ought to be more moderate in their Mournings, then others <hi>which have no hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4, 13. either as to them that are departed, or as to themſelves, or the Publick; and becauſe the Lord had before-hand prepared a hopefull Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.8, 9. <hi>So the days of weeping and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for</hi> Moſes <hi>were ended, And</hi> Joſhua <hi>the Son of</hi> Nun <hi>was full of the ſpirit of Wiſdome,</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> had layd his hands upon him (and ſolemnly deſigned him for the Government) <hi>and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes.</p>
            <p>Let me give you the grounds of the Point; They lament, firſt, Becauſe of the ſtrong Influence that a good Governour hath into the Vitals of a State, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 4.20. they call <hi>Joſiah, The Breath of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils;</hi> ſo the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> expounds it, <hi>Joſiah who was as dear to us as the breath of our Noſtrils, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe ſhadow we ſaid we ſhall live.</hi> I know that <hi>Grotius, Diodati,</hi> and others in their Annotations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, do apply in to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> (who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed taken in the Pits of the Enemies) but if <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> much more might <hi>Joſiah</hi> be termed, <hi>The breath of their Noſtrils,</hi> and that you know is a great matter, 'tis all in all to the naturall body, the heart ſoon ſlakens without it, when it can no longer breath out its warmth, nor fetch in cool Aire to allay its heat: The Spirit of <hi>Reformation</hi> died with him, the State never breathed after <hi>Reformation</hi> more, till after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
            <p>No wonder therefore that Prophet <hi>Zechary,</hi> Ch. 12.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alluded to their mourning for him, telling them <hi>the day ſhould come when their mourning for the</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37085:6"/>Meſſiah, <hi>ſhould be as vehement; as univerſall, as that for</hi> Joſiah, all the Land ſhould mourn in publick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, Families in private meetings, every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apart, and the Leaders of the Families apart, <hi>Like to the mourning in the Valley of</hi> Megiddo, <hi>there</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah <hi>fell, and there they mourned,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.22. And ſuch a mourning is ſuitable to the loſs of One, who hath an eminent Influence into the Welfare of a State firſt, as He is, <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> a common Father, carefull to protect and provide for all, eſpecially for thoſe of the Houſhold of Faith, whom the Miniſters of Chriſt, by his bleſſing upon his Word, <hi>have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. To theſe is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate <hi>a Nurſing Father, Iſa.</hi> 149.23. to carry them in his Boſome (as God ſaid to <hi>Moſes) As a Nurſing Father beareth the ſucking Children, Numb.</hi> 11.12. notwithſtanding all their frowardneſs; doubtleſs ſuch an One was <hi>Joſiah,</hi> Our <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and 'tis no ſmall loſs to the poor people of God to part with ſuch a Friend, ſuch a Father, if we be not ſenſible of it now, we ſhall feel it to our coſt hereafter; but if we feel it now, and it work kindly with us, there is hope that through a ſupply and a Succeſſion of the ſame Spirit, we ſhall feel it the leſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As he is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae,</hi> The Keeper of both Tables, which is clear out of the old Teſtament, and the chief Magiſtrates Duty is not ſo particularly layd down in the New (as is that of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and other Relations) becauſe no ſuch new Members of the viſible Church in the Apoſtles dayes, nor for a long time after, it muſt then be fetched from the old Teſtament, or no where.</p>
            <p>And this is ſo neceſſary, even his looking to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37085:7"/>Duties of the firſt Table, that ſome have ventured to ſay, that a Perſecuting Magiſtrate (as in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church) were ten times rather to be wiſhed, then one careleſs and neglecting to ſet up Ordinances, ſuffering all to run into Irreligion and Heatheniſme: For either by perſecuting, or commending and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the Worſhip of God, the Magiſtrate cauſeth Religion to flouriſh, by doing neither, He takes the way, utterly to aboliſh it: as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate was about to do, had not God cut him off the ſooner: Better a Perſecuter, then a Neuter, better a <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> then a <hi>Gallio; Who careth for none of thoſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what a mercy is it to have a <hi>Ioſiah</hi> indeed, a Prince cordially ſtudious of Religion and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe heart akes and trembles for the Ark of God, as <hi>Elie's</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.13. And who prefers <hi>Ieruſalem before his chiefeſt joyes,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 137.6.</p>
            <p>And what a calamity is it to have ſuch an one taken away, before Reformation be perfected, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.20. After all this, when <hi>Ioſiah</hi> had prepared the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then <hi>Necho</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> comes and cuts him off, when the Church had moſt need of him; For <hi>Iſrael</hi> to loſe a <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they are yet in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs (which is our caſe at this day) this is a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and ought to be unto us for a Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As he is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque Gladii,</hi> The Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of both Swords, Martiall and Civil.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of the Military Sword, He is the great Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Peace and War, and in time of War, he is the chief Leader; ſo was <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> ſo our <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> We might
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37085:7"/>all ſay to him, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Thou waſt he that leddeſt out and broughteſt in</hi> Iſrael <hi>with ſafety and Victory:</hi> How often did he offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf willingly (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.9.) and jeoparded his life in <hi>the high places of the Field?</hi> for Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, for Prudence, Piety, and Succeſs in War, our Leader was Incomparable; This Land, all theſe three Nations will afford him everlaſting Monuments; The God of Peace grant we never feel the want of this great Leader in this particular.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He beareth the Civil Sword alſo, He is the Guardian of all Vindictive Power, God hath put his own Sword of Juſtice into the Magiſtrates hand; He is Gods <hi>Sword-bearer, Rom.</hi> 13.4. none may uſurp it nor reſiſt it.</p>
            <p>There are two things that legitimate the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Vindictive Adminiſtrations: Firſt, That he acts by Gods Authority, and ſecondly, According to his Juſtice, both muſt concur; a private man may not of his own head kill a Malefactor: <hi>Ehues</hi> ſlaying <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Moſes</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> are no patterns for us, unleſs we have the ſame Commiſſion, or privy Seal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exempla heroica ſunt ſupra Regulam:</hi> Nor may the Magiſtrate kill an innocent Perſon: but when he puts a Malefactor to death according to Gods order, 'tis not man, but God that kills him.</p>
            <p>Now to loſe ſuch a Magiſtrate, who bare not the Sword in vain, but durſt draw it againſt the greateſt Tranſgreſſour, and who durſt not touch the pooreſt Innocent with the leaſt of his Fingers (as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is impotent as to the doing of the leaſt evil) <hi>Who could do nothing againſt the truth</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.) and could not but do his utmoſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37085:8"/>for the truth, this is a great loſs unto a people.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As he is <hi>Cuſtos ſalutis publicae,</hi> the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Sentinell of publick Safety, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6. for they are Gods Miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> watching, by the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked, to preſerve and protect the Juſt (as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it) and hereupon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes one Interence, <hi>Ver. 7. Let them have their due</hi> (and all their Miniſters under them) <hi>Cuſtome, Tribute, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Honour:</hi> 'Tis a ſin againſt all equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſcience, to deny or withhold any of theſe from them, ſeeing they are alwaies watching for our Good.</p>
            <p>And let me make another Inference; It is a duty which every man owes the Magiſtrate, in all Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, Overtures and Endeavours, whether relating to matters Civil or Spirituall, to carry it with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimplicity and integrity, otherwiſe to bring in Evils, under painted Vizards, and ſpecious pretenſes, what is it, but to ſurprize theſe Sentinels, and to elude their Vigilance, and that's the practiſe and part of an Enemy: ſuch a Watchman of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> ſuch a Watchman was our <hi>Joſiah;</hi> it was no eaſie matter to ſurprize him: How ſecurely did we ſleep, while He watched over us; <hi>Bene dormivi quia Antipater vigilavit,</hi> I ſlept well to Night (ſayd <hi>Alexander</hi>) becauſe I knew a carefull man was in the Watch. But what ſhall become of us now, that this Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is falne aſleep? If he who keepeth <hi>Iſreal, who neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps,</hi> watch not over us, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Rulers, and help them to watch for us.</p>
            <p>I and all the World may ſay of him that's now gone from us, as one ſaid of <hi>Mucianus</hi> the Roman
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37085:8"/>Conſul; He did <hi>Vim Principis complecti, nomen remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> He had all the power, and performed all the part of a good King, though he refuſed the Title; Cauſe therefore have we to take up a wofull Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when ſuch a Prince, when ſuch a great man is faln in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who in all theſe reſpects had ſo benign an Influence into the Vitals of our State: And that's the firſt ground of the Lamentation.</p>
            <p>A ſecond may be, the rarity and ſcarcity of ſuch as might ſupply ſuch Decayes, fill up ſuch a breach, ſuch an <hi>Hiatus:</hi> Where ſhall a man be found to ſtand in this Gap? He only who hath the reſidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, can ſupply us; And bleſſed be his Name, that he hath made this Noble Vine fruitfull and full of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that there are ſtrong Rods for the Scepters of them that bear Rule; where there is no ſtrong Rod to be a Scepter to Rule (what ever ſome men think) this is a Lamentation, and ſhould be for a Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Judgment, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ult.</hi> O let us pray that the Lord would ſtrengthen theſe Branches, that they may not be broken off, that no Eaſt wind (of Invaſion from abroad) may wither them, no fire (of Contention at home;) conſume them, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, in that Chapter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this is an uſuall Honour that God puts on his eminent and faithfull Servants, when they are gone, their removall is bewayled and lamented; men may marvail as the Diſciples did, to ſee a fruitleſs Fig. tree, ſuddenly withered away, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.20. but there's no moan made, there's no mourning: But when an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Vine dies, which affords both Shade and Fruit, that's a loſs) much more then that of <hi>Jonah's</hi> Gourd) to be lamented, the moſt Serviceable, ſhall alwaies be:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37085:9"/>the moſt Honourable; They that live much deſired, cannot dye but much lamented: as for the wicked and worthleſs perſon, it ſhall be nothing ſo, they ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, <hi>Ah my Brother, Ah Lord,</hi> or <hi>Ah his Glory, He ſhall be buried with the buriall of an Aſs, drawn and caſt forth beyond the Gates of the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The loſs then of a gracious Prince, of a pious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, is very lamentable. The ſecond Point will lead us to look into the Cauſe thereof, and that's this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. The ſins of Gods people are the fall of their Crown; theſe Traytors pull it from the head of a State, or Government: and there was a double ſin at that time moſt remarkable in that people:</p>
            <p>Firſt, They went about to pluck the Crown of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty from Gods head, <hi>They would not hearken to him, nor obey him,</hi> ſee this in <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From the thirteenth year of <hi>Joſiah</hi> (and that was the next year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he began the publick Rerformation; for it is ſayd in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.3. <hi>In the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jeruſalem</hi>) From the very beginning of the Reformation, ſaith <hi>Jeremy,</hi> even unto this day, (for ten years ſpace together) <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me (and it died not with me) But I have ſpoken unto you, riſing early and ſpeaking, but yee have not hearkned. And the Lord hath ſent unto you all his Servants the Prophets, riſing early and ſending them, but yee have not hearkned, nor inclined your Ear to hear; They ſaid, turn yee again now every one, from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and yet yee have not hearkned unto me, ſaith the Lord, that yee might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.</hi> Thus even in a time of Reformation they fell to Apoſtaſy, Idolatry, and Prophaneneſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37085:9"/>they firſt ſunk into Apoſtaſy, and then into Calamity, and the Crown dropt from their head, that was the beginning of it; ſee this further in <hi>Zeph,</hi> 1.1. <hi>The word of the Lord came unto him in the dayes of</hi> Joſiah, <hi>I will utterly conſume all, ſaith the Lord;</hi> Why, what was his Controverſie? ver. 5. <hi>They did worſhip, and ſwear by the Lord, and by</hi> Malcham, they made a hotch potch, a mingle mangle of Religion, they began to curdle and turn by degrees, Ver. 6. <hi>And them that are turned back from the Lord, and thoſe that have not ſought the Lord, nor enquired for him,</hi> but fell to looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lewdneſs, as it is there deſcribed particularly in all ſorts of perſons, from the Prince to the Prentice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They did what in them lay to pluck the Crown from <hi>Joſiah's</hi> head, the faireſt Flower in his Garland, ſtudiouſneſs of Reformation, there was none like him for that, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. and they did what they could to weaken his heart and hands in it, they would not bear it, they loathed it, and waxed weary of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.2. The word of the Lord came unto him in the thirteenth year of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in the time of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mark that, and then hear how the Lord chargeth them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10. <hi>They turned not unto me with their whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord:</hi> they made a ſhew, and talked, and took the Covenant, but they would not ſtand to it, they had no heart to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but hankered ſtill after their former evils. 'Twas time now to rack them from off their Lees, to empty them from Veſſell to Veſſell, to turn them out of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the Viſion of Peace, into <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe very Name ſpeaks Confuſion. The Lord help us to ſee our Faces in this Glaſs; I appeal to your Conſciences, how much of our State and Story is told over in theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37085:10"/>particulars: And yet if there be any hope in our <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this thing, the laſt Obſervation muſt help us to it, and it is this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The ſincere people of God, take up a woſull Mourning not ſo much for the fall of their Crown, as for their ſins that cauſed it, they point the finger at this, they place the Wo upon this, <hi>Wo unto us that we have ſinned.</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 9. of his Book, complains not of miſery (ſave only of the Deſolation of the Sanctuary) but of ſin, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>We have ſinned and committed Iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy Precepts and from thy Judgments; Neither have we hearkned unto thy Servants the Prophets, which ſpake in thy Name to our Kings, our Princes, and our Fathers, and to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land.</hi> This pierced his heart, in the midſt of all his perſonall Preferment. So was it with good <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, Chap.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>(Let thine Ear now be attentive, and thine Eyes open, that thou mayſt hear the Prayer of thy Servant, which I prayed before thee now day and night, for the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>thy Servants, and confeſs the ſins of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which we have ſinned againſt thee, both I and my Fathers houſe have ſinned. We have dealt very corruptly againſt thee, and have not kept thy Commandments, nor the Statutes, nor the Judgments, which thou commandedſt thy Servant</hi> Moſes. Sin, ſin, that lay more heavy upon the hearts of theſe good men, then all their ſufferings: And its clear it muſt be ſo; Firſt; from the nature of ſincere repentance, which is never to be ſo affected with grief lying on our ſpirits, as for our grieving the ſpirit of God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall mourn for him, and be in bitterneſs for him:</hi> and ſo it was, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. When
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37085:10"/>they heard this, that they had crucified the Lord of Life and Glory, this went to their hearts; and this the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> bewails, that they rebelled againſt one who had been ſo tender, ſo indulgent, and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate toward them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9.10. <hi>In all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, in his love and in his pity, he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carryed them all the daies of old. But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit; Therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, nnd he fought againſt them.</hi> So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When ever God intends good to a perſon, or a People, he leads forth their Spirits this way, makes the ſtream of their ſorrows run forth in this Channel, for this is the principall (if not the only) way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and remove their Calamities felt, or feared, when Sinners mourn for ſin, as ſin, then God pardons ſin, and when God pardons Iniquity, he heals Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3.</p>
            <p>If this then be our preſent poſture, though we are made weak by ſuch a loſs, yet he will ſtrengthen us, and give us Healers (that's the Magiſtrates Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.7.) yea this ruine ſhall be under his own hand, and this is the right courſe to lodge it there.</p>
            <p>Now briefly to put all theſe truths together to Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Doth not the Lord call his people in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to a ſerious and ſenſible apprehenſion of ſuch a ſtroke.</p>
            <p>May I not ſay to the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> as this Prophet did to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael? Lament.</hi> 2.13. <hi>What thing ſhall I take to witneſs for thee? what thing ſhall I liken to thee, O daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem? <hi>what ſhall I equall to thee that I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37085:11"/>thee, O Virgin Daughter of</hi> Zion? <hi>for thy breach is great like the Sea, who can heal thee? Our Bank is now broken down, who can repair it; who can heal it? that can he alone who made both the Bank and the Breach; Who at firſt gave a decree to the Sea, and ſhut it up as with Doors and Bars, ſaying, Hitherto ſhalt thou go and no further, and here ſhall thy proud Waves ſtay:</hi> He can keep the Sea from breaking in upon us, at ſuch a time as this, and repair our Bank and Bulwark again. But will he do it? That cannot I tell, but I can tell you of ſeverall Symptomes and Indications of approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mercy, even in times of greateſt Calamity; do you look if you can find them upon your own Spirits, and they are theſe: Firſt, When a Perſon, or People are troubled more for ſin, then for ſuffering, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, or approaching: When they look on ſin as the greateſt, the only evill, when they moſtly bewaile that, that's a ſure ſign of eſcaping; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. <hi>But they that eſcape of them ſhall eſcape, and ſhall be on the Mountains, as Doves of the Valleys, all of them mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every one for his Iniquity.</hi> Now is the Voyce of this Turtle heard in our Land, at this day; When ſin ſits heavy, ſuffering ſits light (ſaid Mr. <hi>Greneham</hi>) And God will make it ſo to be indeed, not to Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to Sence alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When we are layd low in the ſight and ſence of this vileneſs, judging our ſelves worthy of the greateſt puniſhment, unworthy of the leaſt refreſhment, when we ſee cauſe to ſubmit in caſe of Reprobation, much more in caſe of Affliction, when we are thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and caſt down, it is the cuſtome of our gracious God (and from thence his Character) to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of ſuch, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6. God that comforteth thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37085:11"/>that are caſt down; When <hi>Jacob</hi> was in his own Eyes, not worthy of the leaſt of all Gods mercies, then he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes all the miſery ſo nigh unto him, and ſo much dreaded by him; the thing that he feared came not upon him, <hi>Gen</hi> 32.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, When the Spirit of Prayer is kept warme in our hearts, or rather, our hearts kept warm by the Spirit of Prayer, for our ſelves and for others, that's a token for good unto us; when <hi>Job</hi> prayed for his Friends, then God turned his Captivity, <hi>Job</hi> 42.10.</p>
            <p>How do yee feel your hearts Chriſtian? frozen, or flaming, cold, or burning within you? can you pray for your Rulers, for the Publick, for your ſelves, and your Poſterities after you? Doth the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> enquire of the Lord for this thing? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. then will he do it for us, then will he encreaſe us with men like a flock; we ſhall then live and not die, neither ſhall our men be few.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When there's a quiet reſignation of our ſelves, and our affairs to the Lord, not limiting him, but leaving him to his liberty, to take away what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments he pleaſeth, and uſe what Inſtruments he pleaſeth; He will be Maſter over the Sons of men, and when we are willing he ſhould be ſo, all things then ſhall work together for our good: When we can chooſe God, and let him chooſe all the reſt; <hi>David</hi> could not miſcarry when his heart was once wrought over to this reſignment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When the Spirit of Faith is up in our hearts, when through the diſcoveries of his Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, we are enabled ſtill to truſt in him, hang on him, expect good from him, ſo that he cannot ſhake us
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37085:12"/>off; Generous Spirits ſcorn to fail thoſe that depend on them: poor ſinfull Creatures have no other way to engage the great God to ſtand their Friend, but by this dependance; And ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtaid on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee.</hi> When an Hawk purſued a Sparrow ſo cloſe, that it flew into <hi>Xenocrates</hi> his Boſome, <hi>Non oportet ſupplicem prodere,</hi> was his word, and ſhall God give up his Turtle that flies into his Boſome, purſued by Birds of Prey? No, he will never do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.19, 20. Now what hopes have yee Chriſtians? what expectations? Can yee wait upon the Lord, that hideth his Face from the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> can yee reſolve to look for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17. Can yee believe for theſe poor Nations? theſe wounded, wofully wounded, Nations? to have ſlight thoughts of this Wound, is the way never to be healed.</p>
            <p>But what grounds of Faith or hope can you ſhew us; to fix our feet upon at ſuch a time as this?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I could ſhew yee none, yet 'tis a duty in the ſincere people of God with their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> even againſt hope, to believe in hope, and to give Glory to God in believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18.20. But yet God hath not left us without viſible grounds, to ſupport our ſinking expectations concerning theſe Nations: For firſt, our grand Enemies have had all the advantages againſt us, they could wiſh for, and yet have not prevailed; all <hi>Campanella's</hi> projects have been accompliſhed, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy turned into a Free-ſtate (out of which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to fiſh ſome notable Advantages) The <hi>Dutch</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a War againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to weaken both theſe States in their Shipping, wherein they were moſt powerfull and formidable.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:37085:12"/>
            <p> A Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> an horrid one, as that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Polititian could have wiſhed; Philoſophy ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with our Divinity, and what not? and yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Univerſall Monarchy not effected: Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Roſes not yet blaſted, not yet over-topped by the Lillies of <hi>France,</hi> nor our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Croſſes become Perches to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Eagles.</p>
            <p>As if God had ſaid from Heaven, You ſhall have fair play, all that yee can propound to your ſelves, and yet come ſhort of your Reckoning.</p>
            <p>This ſpeaks as if God had no mind to caſt us away, to abandon and give us up as a Prey to the Teeth of our Adverſaries: Let us bleſs the Lord for this, and ſtill believe on him; <hi>Our Soul is eſcaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowlers, the Snare is broken and we are eſcaped. Our help is in the Name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth,</hi> Pſal. 124.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Surely when God thus encamps about his Houſe, 'tis a ſigne that no Oppreſſour ſhall paſs through them any more (if they fall not off from Him) <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Are we not a People, redeemed with ſo high an hand, and ſuch an out-ſtretched Arme, as never People was ſince the dayes of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And hath the Lord been working ſo many Miracles of Mercy, for ſo many yeares together? and will he now undo us, and all his own great Works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? What will he do unto his great Name? What will the Nations ſay? It was not he, it was a chance that hapned to them? What will his and our Enemies ſay and do? There is a ſtupendious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26, 27. <hi>I ſaid that I would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37085:13"/>ſcatter them into Corners, I would make the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them to ceaſe from among men (I would pay them, I would ſmock them, they have deſerved it at my hands) were it not that I feared the wrath of the Enemy, leaſt their Adverſaries ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrangly, and leaſt they ſhould ſay, Our hand is high, the Lord hath not done all this;</hi> Can the great God feare any thing? Yes, God himſelf tells us that he feares, on the behalf of his poor People, that deſire to feare his Name, and what need they to feare Enemies, that have a God to feare for them? Onely let us Sanctifie him in our hearts, and let him be our feare and our dread, and we need feare nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What Spot of Earth (to the praiſe of Free-grace be it ſpoken, not to boaſt of our ſelves carnally) What Spot of Ground in the World beares ſo many reall Saints upon it, as our Iſland? and ſome ſprinklings here alſo, that cry Day and Night unto him? Souls ſealed and marked in the Forehead, not to be touched by the Deſtroyer; Might <hi>Sodome</hi> have ſtood, if there had been but ten righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there; and ſhall not theſe Nations eſcape, who have yet ſo many thouſands to ſtand in the Gap?</p>
            <p>Are not the holy Seed the Sap and Subſtance of our <hi>Robur Anglicanum,</hi> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oke; as an Oke whoſe Subſtance is in it when it caſteth its Leaves, <hi>The holy Seed ſhall be the Subſtance thereof,</hi> Iſa. 6.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, As the new Wine is found in the Cluſter, and one ſaith, deſtroy it not, for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is in it, ſo will</hi> I <hi>do for my Servants ſake, that</hi> I <hi>may not deſtroy them all,</hi> Iſa. 65.8.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37085:13"/>
            <p> And ſurely we have Governours, who ſay in their heart. <hi>The Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be our ſtrength in the Lord of Hosts their God,</hi> Zech. 12.5.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, After all the Wind-falls in Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, ſo many top-heavy, tall Okes and Cedars laid along, thoſe that are Trees of Righteouſneſs indeed and kept their ſtanding, are more deeply rooted by all theſe ſhakings; Profeſſours were never ſo ſober, ſince the times of Perſecution, never ſo in love with old Truths, they ſee plainly the pretended new light was an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> that miſled poor benighted Souls, yea many that erred come now to underſtanding, and they that murmured are better inſtructed, according to that ſweet Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.24. <hi>We ſhall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be aſhamed of our hope, neither ſhall our faces wax pale.</hi> For as the prevailing of the Spirit of Error was the Herald of Miſery, ſo is the returning of a Spirit of Sobriety the welcome Harbinger of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, So many hopefull young men coming on to the Miniſtry (which is the Obſervation of our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> in their Ordinations) their Parts more raiſed, their Lives more reformed, the Councel of God more clearly revealed then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; even this beſpeaks a continuance of Mercy: Surely the great Husbandman hath yet ſome Harveſt to Inn, ſeeing he makes ſuch proviſion and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Labourers, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>After theſe things, the Lord appointed other Seventy alſo, and ſent them two and two before his face, into every City and place, whither he himſelf would come.</hi> Where Chriſt ſends his Diſciples before him, he himſelf means to follow after; the Treaty to Peace holds, whilſt his Leiger-Embaſſadours are not recalled.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:37085:14"/>
            <p> Sixthly, The generall ſenſe of this heavy ſtroke is a good ſign among us.</p>
            <p>Indeed when the Righteous is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart, then there's evil to come, Iſa. 57.1. But I am perſwaded no ſtroke theſe thouſand years hath been more felt by the beſt people of theſe Nations: the mourning is univerſall, like that in <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only amongſt the Rulers, the Families of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> not only amongſt the Miniſters, the Family of <hi>Levi;</hi> but even the Family of <hi>Shimei,</hi> who was of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> a Male-content, a Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, That comes along in the Train of the Mourners: we read indeed of others of that Name who were of the houſe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but that cannot be here meant, becauſe it was before mentioned by Name. Its ſtrange indeed to find the Family of <hi>Shimei</hi> mourning for the loſs of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> yet the Lord can bring this to paſs, and hath done ſo at this time (If I be rightly informed) 'tis ſayd of <hi>Galba,</hi> that he left but few willing to live under his Government, but many mourning for his death: How many do now confeſs they were unworthy of ſuch a Ruler? they knew not how to priſe, how to improve ſuch a Mercy, and when we cut out Fingers with Swords, 'tis time they ſhould be layd up.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That the great Plot of fiering <hi>London,</hi> raiſing the Countries, betraying the Ports and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, was utterly broken, before this Blow was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; That this man of War ſhould die himſelf in Peace (contrary to the Propheſyings of many) and leave us in peace; This ſpeaks much tenderneſs in our God towards us, that ſuch a ſtorm ſhould be blown over (and a day of Thanſgiving kept through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37085:14"/>the three Nations for it) before this skilfull Pilot was called from the Helm. Indeed when the Pilot is caſt over board in a ſtorm, it fore-ſpeaks a Shipwrack. But now that the Lord hath thus in meaſure debated with us (notwithſtanding all our Luxuriancies) and ſtayed the rough wind, in the day of the blaſting Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; well may we hope, that by <hi>This ſhall the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged,</hi> and that this ſhall be the Fruit to take away our ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8, 9. that his deſigne is to purge and prune us, not to root us up.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That we ſhould ſlide ſo quietly, ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into a Settlement, I think far beyond all our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, this is a wonderfull Mercy, <hi>Sol occubuts, nox nulla ſecuta eſt,</hi> Our Sun is ſet, and yet no Night enſued.</p>
            <p>Now for Light to riſe when the Sun ſets, that at Evening time it ſhould be light (according to that promiſe in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.7.) this is not only a ſign of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but a Miracle of mercy it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, That we now have Magiſtrates, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallity of whoſe Call to their preſent Office and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is beyond all diſpute, all ſettled by Authority of Parliament; The Scepter put into his Highneſs's hand, that now is, according to the Sanction of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: The Sword put into his Excellencies hand hereafter his late Highneſs's eſtabliſhment by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Even this may give us a rationall ground of hope, of quietneſs and ſubmiſſion, even in the moſt unquiet Spirits: at leaſt they will have a leſs reaſon to pretend for their unquietneſs, though unquiet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons never want pretenſes.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, We enjoy Magiſtrates, to whom the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion, is ſo endeared, ſo incorporated, by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37085:15"/>a Principle of Grace in themſelves, that they can no more forſake or abandon it, then their own Souls, and ſo intwiſted by the hand of Providence, with their own Intereſt, that they cannot be ſafe if they quit it: their Authority, their Safety is Embarqued in the ſame Bottom with it, they muſt ſwim, or ſink toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Now, God promis'd it of old as a Favour to his People, that their Nobles ſhould be of themſelves, and that their Governours ſhould proceed out of the midſt of them (Let not us deſpiſe ours, becauſe they do ſo) <hi>And I will cauſe him to draw neer, and he ſhall approach unto me, for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 30.21. It is an admirable thing when Rulers and Governours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their hearts to approach unto God, God himſelf ſeems to be taken with it, and to wonder at it; Let us help them with our Prayers to engage more and more, with and for God, for this alſo ſpeaks eſtabliſhment, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and proſperity, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>And out of them ſhall proceed thankſgiving, and the voice of them that make merry, and I will multiply them, and they ſhall not be few, I will alſo glorifie them, and they ſhall not be ſmall; Their Children alſo ſhall be as afore-time, and their Congregation ſhall be eſtabliſhed before me, and</hi> I <hi>will puniſh all that oppreſs them, And their Nobles ſhall be of themſelves, and their Governour ſhall proceed from the midſt of them, and</hi> I <hi>will cauſe him to draw neer, and he ſhall approach unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, The late Succeſs of the <hi>Swede,</hi> and our own Succeſs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> putting a Curb, and a Bridle upon the Jaws of our ill Neighbours, theſe look like the Pledges and Fore-runners of more mercy.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37085:15"/>
            <p> Laſtly, And eſpecially ſome beginnings of reall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and breathings after more, in Perſons, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Congregations, Towns, Cities, Countries; theſe where ever they are to be diſcerned, look very ſmilingly and promiſingly upon us: Indeed if Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be neglected, all our other grounds of hope will faile us and float away, <hi>If the people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them, neither do ſeek the Lord of Hoſts, then will he ſet up their Adverſaries againſt them and joyn their Enemies together, and they ſhall devour</hi> Iſrael <hi>with open Mouth,</hi> Iſa. 9.11, 12.13. And thou, who ever thou art that hateſt to be reformed, mayſt be one of the firſt, that ſhall be ſo devoured; But if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation be cordially endeavoured by us, according to our places, this will make us precious in the ſight of the Lord, and he will make us honourable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. if this be purſued (I am not affraid to affirm it) as ſin hath pluckt the Crown from our head, ſo Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will reſtore it, and ſet it again upon the head of our State and Government; yea the Lord will redeem our life from deſtruction, and (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.4.) <hi>Crown us with loving kindneſs and tender mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without Reformation, we are a loſt People, but if the Lord make us a reforming People, we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a preſerved People, that will reſtore our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, our Glory to us; <hi>Come therefore and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heale us, he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up.</hi>
